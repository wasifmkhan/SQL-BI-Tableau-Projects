Dataset from Kaggle.
In this project, we explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. 
We go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. We go from basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. We work on the following skills in this video:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function
- Tableau


Since this project is about B2B:

RFM analysis
-	Recency Frequency Monetary
-	Indexing technique that uses part purchase behaviour to segment customers
-	RFM report is a way of segmenting customer using 3 key metrics:
  1. Recency (how long ago the purchase was)
  2. Frequency (how often are they buying)
  3. Monetary value (how much they spent)
-	Allows us to answer questions like is this a high value customer, or low value customer
-	In this dataset,
  1. Recency: last order date
  2. Frequency: count of today orders
  3. Monetary: Total spend
